PCF8574 Arduino Library

Designed for using PCF8574 (or PCF8574A) I/O port expander with Arduino. Specifically for using the pins for GPIO.

Library allows you to easily connect, set, and read to multiple PCF8574s at different addresses. You can read or write full bytes or individual bits, and you can also toggle a specific bit.

This library is released under the GNU GPL V2.0. Written by James Petersen.

This is the author's first attempt at writing a library. If you have requests for additional features, suggestions for improvements, or positive/negative feed back, please feel free to post. Updates will be released as they become available. To contribute to this project, contact the author through Git.
